For our test plan we came up with a few things. To start we did basic inputs to make sure our server and client works. For our client side, we input the wrong amount of arguments to make sure the client side will close and not continue and as well on the server side. Then we did the correct inputs for the commands. When we type “create” and then the “user name”, the server stores the username in a messagebox. Then we tested to make sure that the names had to be at least 5 characters and less than 26 characters. When we did this, the server sent out “ER:WHAT?” meaning that it was not created. Then we created multiple message boxes and they were all properly created. Then we tried to open multiple message boxes because the assignment description was not specific on what to do in this scenario, so we handled it by closing the currently opened box and opening the requested box. The server successfully did that. We deleted non-existing message boxes which successfully output the correct error. We created multiple message boxes and opened each one and put a message in each corresponding message box. And then we disconnected and connected again, then deleted the messages in each message box by using the “next” command. Afterwards we deleted all the message boxes and quit the program again and it successfully worked.
